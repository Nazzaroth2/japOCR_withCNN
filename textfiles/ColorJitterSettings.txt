Saturation only usefull when working with colors not black-white (e.g. red on black would work too)

Hue is very usefull when working with color. I will only need maybe 3 base colorSettings and
with hue jitter i can get infinite colorcombinations for training.
Hue also doesnt work when its black-white or white-black
